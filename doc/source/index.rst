.. note::

  These documents will be reworked to reflect the changes associated with
  becoming an OpenStack hosted project: Airship. Expect major changes to occur
  with time. See more at `airshipit.org`_

Welcome to Airship documentation!
=================================

Airship is a collection of components that coordinate to form a means of
configuring, deploying and maintaining a `Kubernetes`_ environment using a
declarative set of `yaml`_ documents. More details on using parts of Airship
may be found by using the `Treasuremap`_

Approach
--------
Airship revolves around the setup and use of Kubernetes and `Helm`_ and takes
cues from these projects. The first use case of Airship is the deployment
of `OpenStack-Helm`_ which also influences Airship's direction.

Building this Documentation
---------------------------

Use of ``make docs`` will build a html version of this documentation that can
be viewed using a browser at doc/build/index.html on the local filesystem.

Specification Details
---------------------

Proposed, approved, and implemented specifications_ for
Airship projects are available.
