Airship Security Vulnerability Management
=========================================

The Airship community is committed to expediently confirming, resolving, and
disclosing all reported security vulnerabilities. We appreciate your
cooperation and participation in our vulnerability management process outlined
below.

Report a Vulnerability
----------------------

If you discover a vulnerability in an Airship project, please treat the issue
with a sense of confidentiality and disclose it to the `airship-security
mailing list`_:

    airship-security@lists.airshipit.org

Additionally, please include any potential fixes, as doing so can expedite the
disclosure and patching processes.

The Airship Working Committee is the sole subscriber of the `airship-security
mailing list`_ and monitors it for reported vulnerabilities. The committee
confirms or rejects reported vulnerabilities in correspondence with the
vulnerability reporter. In the event that the Airship Working Committee does
not have the expertise or availability to resolve a reported vulnerability, the
committee may solicit assistance from outside contributors to better facilitate
the understanding and resolution of reported security vulnerabilities.

Receive Early Disclosures
-------------------------

We prefer to disclose confirmed security vulnerabilities as soon as possible.
While circumstances may not always allow immediate disclosure, vulnerabilities
may be disclosed over the `airship-embargo-notice mailing list`_ when a fix
becomes available. The airship-embargo-notice mailing list notifies Airship
users of confirmed vulnerabilities. If you operate Airship in a production
environment, we recommend subscribing to the `airship-embargo-notice mailing
list`_ by contacting the Airship Working Committee. The Airship Working
Committee evaluates subscription requests on a case-by-case basis.

Receive Public Disclosures
--------------------------

Within ninety days of the initial vulnerability report, except in unusual
circumstances, the Airship Working Committee will publicly disclose the
reported vulnerability and its mitigation over the `airship-announce`_ and
`airship-discuss`_ mailing lists. If a fix merges before the aforementioned
ninety day period expires, the Airship Working Committee will instead disclose
the vulnerability and fix twenty-one days later. We recommend subscribing to
both mailing lists in order to receive security updates.
